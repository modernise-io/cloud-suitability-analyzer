advice: Identified the use of the Struts framework (Struts 2) in the XML configuration. This may pose a few challenges due to its complex XML-based configuration, server-side session management, and tight coupling with Java EE application server. Consider refactoring the application with a more lightweight web framework, such as Spring Boot . Automatic remediation with Bootifier / Spring Boot Migrator may be available.
