advice: App should be executed as a stateless process. User session information could be store in the database (Ex https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/configure-sql-server-session-state-in-asp-net-core/). A better approach is to use a Redis or SQL Server distributed cache, which doesn't require sticky sessions. For more information, see Distributed caching in ASP.NET Core (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/distributed?view=aspnetcore-7.0).
