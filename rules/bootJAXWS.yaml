advice: Identified usage of JAX-WS (Java API for XML Web Services) components, traditionally associated with SOAP-based web services. consider migrating away from JAX-WS to more lightweight and RESTful web service alternatives, such as Spring Boot with JAX-RS (Java API for RESTful Web Services). Automatic remediation with Bootifier / Spring Boot Migrator may be available.
