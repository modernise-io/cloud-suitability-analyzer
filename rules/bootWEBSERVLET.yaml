advice: Detected the use of WebSocket configurations in the XML file - a technology for enabling real-time communication in web applications. WebSocket connections can be long-lived, which may pose challenges in scenarios requiring rapid scaling.  WebSocket-based applications may also require specific infrastructure support for load balancing and handling large numbers of concurrent connections. To address scalability and efficient WebSocket management in a cloud-native context, consider WebSocket gateways or brokers. These components act as intermediaries between clients and WebSocket servers, helping distribute incoming WebSocket connections and messages effectively. Automatic remediation with Bootifier / Spring Boot Migrator may be available.
